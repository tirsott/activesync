About pyActiveSync
-----------------
pyActiveSync is a pure python client-side library for the Microsoft ActiveSync protocol.

Goal is to create an easy to read, extensible, and usable implementation of client-side ActiveSync protocol (v12+) in python (for now v2.7).

So far, most ActiveSync commands (i.e. raw functionality) are implemented and working correctly. 
See dev_playground.py and misc_tests.py for examples of "raw functionality" usage.

TODO:
-Finish implementing/testing: Sync command client->server, Search and Settings commands, AS Proxy support, AutoDiscover, and Rights Management support
-Cleanup builder and parser return values so they are consistent and predictable
-Create pythonic(ish) API (to further abstract xml/wbxml building and parsing, and http requests)
-General code cleanup, inconsistency resolution
-Convert into module
-Add ActiveSync status handling helpers
-Add (tiered) logging to all components
-Add unit testing suite
-Performance analysis/enhancments
-Submit to PyPI

-Create python 3 version?
-Add protocol versioning support?
-Create sample ActiveSync client using PySide?
